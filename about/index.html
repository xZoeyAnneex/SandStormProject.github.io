<h1>About</h1>
<h2>About the Group</h2>
<p>SandStormProject isn't just one project, we split into multiple groups such as FrostByte Games. The SandStormProject's main goal is to re-invent gaming, hence the tagline "Re-Inventing Gaming for the Future". We try to change the way people think of games through modding, YouTube videos and creating games that we hope everyone will enjoy.</p>
<h2>About Turtle</h2>
<p>Turtle does most of the coding work but will often livestream on <a href="twitch.tv">twitch</a> and sometimes will upload videos to YouTube. He is the person who set up TeamTurtle and eventually decided that the name was making the group seem too heirarchal so he re-named the group to the SandStormProject since it was a neutral name and it didn't really tell people who is in charge. With the new name change in place he was hoping for people not to blame him for everything instantly even if it wasn't his fault, this worked to some extent however with the people who knew about this change it didn't work so well. Everyone in the team are now treat equally thanks to this change and they are all on one level.</p>

<h2>About Chloee</h2>
<p>Chloee is also a big part of the group providing some hilarious things to the group. Chloee helps with most of the graphics in any of Turtle's projects, all it takes is a quick tweet and she is normally on board. She used to do a lot of YouTube videos and Twitch livestreams but has steadily slowed down to a stop purely because of bad equipment and her laptop has broke recently. Chloee is a really nice girl and is normally up for anything however Turtle really would like to do her to do more and for the rest of the group to do more but understands that most of them are going through a period called "Exams". Chloee isn't the youngest of the group but is one of the youngest in her year at school.</p>

<h2>About Stephen</h2>
<p>Stephen is a great part of the group, he is mainly tests the mods and games that Turtle brings out. However we would like to see him do some coding in the future or maybe even do some videos. He is the youngest in the group and has taken Computer Science as a GCSE however down to our school he doesn't know Java and probably won't while he is still at that school. He does a lot of gaming so he is like a researcher in the group and will tell Turtle if he has done something wrong with anything in his games or mods. Stephen gives a lot of ideas to Turtle for his projects which means a lot more projects to come! Without Stephen, Turtle wouldn't be able to come up with half of his ideas for mods</p>

<p>As you can see a lot of the work isn't down to Turtle. If you are interested in joining the team tweet to Turtle and he will try to contact you as soon as possible.</p>
